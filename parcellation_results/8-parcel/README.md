### Files:

- `cluster_assignments.json`: Lists the cluster IDs within each parcel, alongside the associated tract that the cluster belongs to. These IDs correspond to clusters in the ORG-800FC-100HCP atlas (available at https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/ORG-Atlases)
- `*.mrml`: Individual parcel .mrml files for visualisation in software such as 3D Slicer
